## 🚀 What is This?

Claw Conductor is a **full autonomous development orchestrator** that transforms a single Discord message into a complete, working software project.

### The Problem

Building software requires multiple AI models for different tasks:
- **Database design** → Best with Mistral Devstral (256K context)
- **Unit tests** → Best with Llama 3.3 70B (test generation expert)
- **Frontend UI** → Best with Mistral Devstral (near-Claude quality)
- **API endpoints** → Best with Llama or Mistral
- **Research** → Best with Perplexity (internet access)

Manually coordinating these models is tedious and error-prone.

### The Solution

**Single Discord request:**
```
@OpenClaw use claw-conductor to build a towing dispatch system with:
- Customer portal for requesting service
- Driver dashboard for accepting jobs
- Admin panel for managing users
- Real-time location tracking
```

**Claw Conductor automatically:**
1. ✨ **Decomposes** into 8 subtasks with dependencies
2. 🎯 **Routes** each to the optimal model (Mistral/Llama/Perplexity)
3. ⚡ **Executes** up to 5 tasks in parallel
4. 📦 **Consolidates** results, runs tests, commits to git
5. 🐙 **Pushes** complete project to GitHub

**Result:** Working dispatch system in ~45 minutes, zero manual intervention.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Always-On Triage & Discord Integration

**The Problem:** Not every Discord message needs full orchestration. Questions like "What's the status?" shouldn't trigger decomposition.

**The Solution:** Claw Conductor acts as an **always-on layer** that intelligently routes requests:

#### Triage Classification
- **Simple Mode** (📋): Questions, status checks, explanations → Fast model response
- **Development Mode** (🔧): Build, fix, implement requests → Full orchestration pipeline

#### Discord Channel Mapping
```
Discord #scientific-calculator → /root/projects/scientific-calculator
Discord #dispatch-suite → /root/projects/dispatch-suite
Discord #satire-news → /root/projects/satire-news
```

Each Discord channel in "Active Projects" category automatically maps to its project workspace.

#### User Overrides
```
@OpenClaw !simple Build a calculator  → Forces simple mode (just answers)
@OpenClaw !dev What is this project?  → Forces development mode (probably errors)
```

#### Example Flows

**Simple Request:**
```
User: "What files are in this project?"
  → 📋 Simple response mode
  → Fast answer from Mistral Devstral (project-aware)
  → Response in ~2 seconds
```

**Development Request:**
```
User: "Add user authentication with email verification"
  → 🔧 Development mode - full orchestration
  → Decompose into 5 tasks
  → Execute in parallel
  → Complete project in ~15 minutes
```

### AI-Powered Task Decomposition

- **Intelligent Analysis**: Uses AI models to analyze complex requests and break them into structured tasks
- **Auto-Selection**: Automatically picks the best model from your registry (or manual override)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Falls back to second-best model on failure
- **Structured Output**: Generates tasks with categories, complexity ratings, dependencies, and file targets

### Intelligent Multi-Model Routing

- **Capability-Based Scoring**: 1-5 star ratings per model per task category
- **Complexity Analysis**: Hard ceilings prevent overwhelming models
- **Cost Optimization**: Prefers free models when capabilities equal
- **Experience Tracking**: Learns which models perform best over time

### Parallel Task Execution

- **Worker Pool**: Up to 5 tasks running simultaneously
- **Dependency-Aware**: Database tasks complete before auth tasks
- **File Conflict Detection**: Tasks touching same files run sequentially
- **Multi-Project Support**: Handle multiple concurrent project requests

### Complete Project Delivery

- **Auto-Setup**: Creates workspace, git repo, GitHub repo
- **Test Execution**: Runs pytest, npm test, etc.
- **Conventional Commits**: Clean git history with co-authorship
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic push on completion

python3 router.py --test
```

---

## 🎓 How It Works

### 1. Task Decomposition

Analyzes your request and breaks into categorized subtasks:

```python
Request: "Build user registration with email verification"

Subtasks:
├─ Database schema (database-operations, complexity: 3)
├─ Registration API (api-development, complexity: 3)
├─ Email verification (backend-development, complexity: 4)
├─ Registration UI (frontend-development, complexity: 2)
└─ Unit tests (unit-test-generation, complexity: 3)
```

**Dependencies:** API depends on database, UI depends on API, tests depend on all

### 2. Intelligent Routing

Each task scored 0-100 against all models:

```
Example: API Development (complexity: 3)

Mistral Devstral 2512:
  Rating: 4★ (40 pts)
  Complexity fit: Can handle 3 (40 pts)
  Experience: 0 tasks (0 pts)
  Cost: Free tier (10 pts)
  Total: 90/100

Llama 3.3 70B:
  Rating: 4★ (40 pts)
  Complexity fit: Can handle 4 (40 pts)
  Experience: 2 tasks (2 pts)
  Cost: Free (10 pts)
  Total: 92/100 ✅ Winner
```

### 3. Parallel Execution

```
Worker Pool (max 5 concurrent):

Worker 1: Database schema (Mistral) → Running
Worker 2: Registration UI (Devstral) → Running
Worker 3: Tests (Llama) → Queued (waits for API)
Worker 4: -
Worker 5: -

After database completes:
Worker 1: Registration API (Llama) → Running

After API completes:
Worker 1: Tests (Llama) → Running
```

### 4. Result Consolidation

```bash
# After all tasks complete:
1. Check git status for conflicts → None
2. Run tests: npm test → ✅ Passed
3. Commit: "feat: user-registration - 5 tasks completed"
4. Push to github.com/{user}/user-registration
5. Report to Discord: "✅ Project completed!"
```
